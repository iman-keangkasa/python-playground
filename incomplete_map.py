def find_static_element():
    '''
    This function will
    find the static

    A static element will
    be assign a probability

    This function will
    find the dynamic

    Please consider:
    [ ] Should the probability
        be based on estimation

    [ ] Should the probability
        be based on Shannon

    [ ] Should the probability
        just decay through time?
    [ ] Should the probability
